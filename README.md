# ETL-Project Group 2
## Objective
    Obtain datasets from two sources to determine the progress on vaccination against COVID-19 for each state in the United States. 

## How?
    Downloaded two dataset from two different sources:
    * data.world
    * kaggle.com

    From data.world a data set of total population by state was obtained. This dataset was then combined with a dataset reporting progress on vaccination per each state, starting on Jan, 2021. With these two datasets, the progress on vaccination per state can be tracked. All data is stored in a database. From the database, total people vaccinated per state and per month can be obtained. 

    The developed code allows to autmotacally update the database as the vaccination dataset is updated in kaggle.com.
